# dotfiles

Config files for:

- `terminal` (Mac)
- `git`
- `tmux`

There is a `new_computer.sh` script that should help me with to set up a new Mac from scratch. 

Also my current vs code settings are located in [https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96) which I sync using git-sync
