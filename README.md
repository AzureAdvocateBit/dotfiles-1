This repo contains config files for various things (mostly for a macOS setup). The idea is to help me customise a new computer in an easy and smooth way.

:warning: Since this is adapted to my own profile and usage **everything is super customised** use everything at your own risk :warning:.


There is a `new_computer.sh` script that should help me with to set up a new Mac from scratch. 

Also my current vs code settings are located in [https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96) which I sync using git-sync
