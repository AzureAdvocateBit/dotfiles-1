# dotfiles

This repo contains config files for various things (mostly for a macOS setup). The idea is to help me customise a new computer in an easy and smooth way.

:warning: Since this is adapted to my own profile and usage **everything is super customised** use everything at your own risk :warning:.

**Update** now I am using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#getting-started):
to proceed run "sh ./install" this will do all the magic and call `new_computer.sh` too.

Also my current vs code settings are located in [https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96) which I sync using git-sync
